# Cross-Over-Alpha


This project aims to create crossovers between two input texts.
It involves using word embeddings,text similarity,and character based lstm and gru models to generate crossovers.

A extensive set of techniques are used to ensure that the right training data is fed into the model.

Uses GPT2 for word level predictions and LSTM/GRU for char level. The entire pipeline can be run using the config file
present in the Data Files folder.
