# Cross-Over-Alpha


This project aims to create crossovers between two input texts.
It involves using word embeddings,text similarity,and character based lstm and gru models to generate crossovers.

A extensive set of techniques are used to ensure that the right training data is fed into the model.

Currently work is being done to incorporate transformers(GPT2) instead of LSTM/GRU models and to find the right set of evaluation metrics.
